                <p>Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a markup language either — it is a
                    style sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML
                    documents. For example, to select all the paragraph elements on an HTML page and turn the text
                    within them red, you'd write this CSS:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>p {
                    color: red;
                  }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>The whole structure is called a rule set (but often "rule" for short). Note also the names of the
                    individual parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="definition">Selector</span> - the HTML element name at the start of the rule set.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="definition">Declaration</span> - a single rule like <code
                            class="inline-code">color: red;</code> specifying which of the element's properties you want
                        to style.</li>
                    <li><span class="definition">Properties</span> - ways in which you can style a given HTML element.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="definition">Property value</span> - to the right of the property after the colon,
                        we have the property value, which chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given
                        property (there are many <code class="inline-code">color</code> values besides <code
                            class="inline-code">red</code>).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style
                    information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind
                    that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that
                    different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
                    <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the
                        computer's memory.</li>
                    <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as
                        embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
                        process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
                    <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into
                        different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it
                        works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as
                        required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
                    <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been
                        applied to it.</li>
                    <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
                </ol>

            <article>
                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want
                    it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                    across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS
                    from the head of your document.</p>
                <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <code
                        class="inline-code">styles.css</code>. The <code class="inline-code">.css</code> extension shows
                    that this is a CSS file.</p>
                <p>To link <code class="inline-code">styles.css</code> to <code class="inline-code">index.html</code>
                    add the following line somewhere inside the <code class="inline-code">&lthead&gt</code> of the HTML
                    document:</p>
                <pre><code>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt</code></pre>
                <p>This &ltlink&gt element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the <code
                        class="inline-code">rel</code> attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of
                    the <code class="inline-code">href</code> attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a
                    rule to <code class="inline-code">styles.css</code>.</p>

            <header>Conflicting rules</header>
            <article>
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that first word <em>cascading</em> is incredibly important
                    to understand — the way that the cascade behaves is key to understanding CSS.</p>
                <p>At some point, you will be working on a project and you will find that the CSS you thought should be
                    applied to an element is not working. Usually the problem is that you have created two rules which
                    could potentially apply to the same element. The <strong>cascade</strong>, and the closely-related concept of
                    <strong>specificity</strong>, are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict. Which
                    rule is styling your element may not be the one you expect, so you need to understand how these
                    mechanisms work.</p>
                <p>Stylesheets cascade — at a very simple level this means that the order of CSS rules matter; when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.</p>
                <p><strong>Specificity</strong> is how the browser decides which rule applies if multiple rules have different selectors, but could still apply to the same element. It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An element selector is less specific — it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page — so will get a lower score.</li>
                    <li>A class selector is more specific — it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value — so will get a higher score.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.</p>
                <p>For example, if you set a <code class="inline-code">color</code> and <code class="inline-code">font-family</code> on an element, every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.</p>
                <p>Some properties do not inherit — for example if you set a <code class="inline-code">width</code> of 50% on an element, all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width. If this was the case, CSS would be very frustrating to use!</p>
